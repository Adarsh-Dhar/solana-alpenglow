Validator  0: Aggregating from 10 total votes...
🔥 CERTIFICATE FORMED for (8, None)! Stake: 800
🚦 Validator  0: Observed SkipCertificate. Setting BadWindow flag to TRUE.

Validator  0: Checking conditions to cast FinalVote for slot 7...
❌ Validator  0: CANNOT cast FinalVote. BadWindow flag is active.

--- Simulation Results ---
A SkipCertificate was formed because 800/1000 stake voted to skip, exceeding the 60% threshold.
This correctly triggered the BadWindow flag, preventing optimistic finalization votes and maintaining network safety during a period of liveness failure.
Timeout handling successful
