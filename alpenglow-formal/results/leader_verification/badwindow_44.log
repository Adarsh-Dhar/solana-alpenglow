Running leader verification: badwindow test, window 10, failure rate 20%, seed 44
--- Alpenglow Leader Window Simulation ---
Leader window size is 10 slots. A leader will fail at slot 15.

--- Simulation Complete ---
The simulation shows how a failure inside the leader window triggers the BadWindow state.
This state persists until the window has slid far enough past the failure, allowing the system to automatically recover to its high-performance mode.
Leader rotation successful
