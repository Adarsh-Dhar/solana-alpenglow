--- SCENARIO 3: Network Partition Recovery ---

PHASE 1: Network is partitioned. Validators can only see votes from their own partition.
Partition A Certificates: {}

RESULT (During Partition):
✅ SUCCESS (Safety): No certificate was formed in Partition A as it lacks a 60% supermajority.
   The network is stalled but safe from a chain split.

PHASE 2: Partition heals. All nodes can now see all votes.

RESULT (After Healing):
✅ SUCCESS (Recovery): A certificate was formed after healing!
   The network successfully recovered and can now make progress on a single, unified chain.
Partition recovery successful
