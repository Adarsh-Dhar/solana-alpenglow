Running resilience verification: safety test, 10% byzantine, 20% offline, seed 39

--- SCENARIO 1: Safety with 10% Byzantine Stake ---
Adversary will try to get two certificates for Slot 10 ('BLOCK_A' and 'BLOCK_B').

RESULT:
âœ… SUCCESS: Safety maintained. It's impossible to form two conflicting certificates.
   The adversary can't force honest nodes to vote twice, and the remaining stake is insufficient to reach the 60% threshold for two separate blocks.
Safety maintained
