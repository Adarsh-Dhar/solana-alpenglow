Running certificate verification: equivocation attack, 15% adversary, seed 25
--- Alpenglow Certificate Uniqueness Simulation ---

An adversary (Validator 99, Stake: 100) will try to notarize two blocks for Slot 5.

âœ… Validator 0 (Stake: 50): Voted for hash 'Some("block-hash-alpha")' in slot 5.
âœ… Validator 1 (Stake: 50): Voted for hash 'Some("block-hash-alpha")' in slot 5.
âœ… Validator 2 (Stake: 50): Voted for hash 'Some("block-hash-alpha")' in slot 5.
âœ… Validator 3 (Stake: 50): Voted for hash 'Some("block-hash-alpha")' in slot 5.
âœ… Validator 4 (Stake: 50): Voted for hash 'Some("block-hash-alpha")' in slot 5.
âœ… Validator 5 (Stake: 50): Voted for hash 'Some("block-hash-alpha")' in slot 5.
âœ… Validator 6 (Stake: 50): Voted for hash 'Some("block-hash-alpha")' in slot 5.
âœ… Validator 7 (Stake: 50): Voted for hash 'Some("block-hash-alpha")' in slot 5.
âœ… Validator 8 (Stake: 50): Voted for hash 'Some("block-hash-alpha")' in slot 5.
âœ… Validator 9 (Stake: 50): Voted for hash 'Some("block-hash-bravo")' in slot 5.
âœ… Validator 10 (Stake: 50): Voted for hash 'Some("block-hash-bravo")' in slot 5.
âœ… Validator 11 (Stake: 50): Voted for hash 'Some("block-hash-bravo")' in slot 5.
âœ… Validator 12 (Stake: 50): Voted for hash 'Some("block-hash-bravo")' in slot 5.
âœ… Validator 13 (Stake: 50): Voted for hash 'Some("block-hash-bravo")' in slot 5.
âœ… Validator 14 (Stake: 50): Voted for hash 'Some("block-hash-bravo")' in slot 5.
âœ… Validator 15 (Stake: 50): Voted for hash 'Some("block-hash-bravo")' in slot 5.
âœ… Validator 16 (Stake: 50): Voted for hash 'Some("block-hash-bravo")' in slot 5.
âœ… Validator 17 (Stake: 50): Voted for hash 'Some("block-hash-bravo")' in slot 5.
 Adversary 99 maliciously creates votes for BOTH hashes.

Validator 100: Aggregating certificates from vote pool...
  - Checking (5, Some("block-hash-alpha")): Total stake = 550/1000
  - Checking (5, Some("block-hash-bravo")): Total stake = 550/1000

--- Simulation Results ---
ðŸ”µ NOTE: No certificate was formed because neither option reached the 60% threshold.
Final stake for Hash A: 550 (Honest: 450, Adversary: 100)
Final stake for Hash B: 550 (Honest: 450, Adversary: 100)
Required stake: 600
Because neither side could reach the threshold alone, and honest validators did not vote for both, no conflicting certificate could be created.
Certificate uniqueness maintained
